# Android-Attendance-App
The Android-Based Attendance Management System is a powerful and user-friendly solution designed to simplify the process of managing student attendance in educational institutions. 
Developed using Android Studio, this system allows faculty members to register students, manage subjects, and efficiently track attendance. 
The system is divided into two key modules: the Admin Module and the Teacher Module.

The Admin Module offers complete control, enabling administrators to add students, faculty, and teachers, as well as view detailed student and teacher information. 
Admins can also monitor student attendance and view individual records for comprehensive oversight. 
The Teacher Module allows teachers to take attendance in a class-wise manner, register new students, and view or edit attendance records. 
Teachers can also save notes by subject and enjoy the benefit of a simple, intuitive interface designed for ease of use.

The system requires Android Studio (latest version), an internet connection, and Java for development. 
Admin access is secured with predefined login credentials (Username: admin, Password: admin123). 
Installation is straightforward, ensuring quick setup and deployment for administrators and teachers, offering a secure and efficient platform for attendance management."# Edulog-Student-Attendance-Application"
